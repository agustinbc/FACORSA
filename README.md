# FACORSA

SAP-like MRP software that computes the required materiales to meet production quota - it also has a tracking record system for material orders, has an inventory system and a list of materials.

It was written in Python. PyQt5 was used for the graphical interface, SQLite3 was used for db management, pandas was used for dataframe manipulation, and pdfkit to get the output.
